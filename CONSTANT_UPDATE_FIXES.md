# Constant Update Fixes Applied

## Problem
The map and dashboard were updating every few seconds, causing:
- Map markers to flicker/re-render constantly
- Station colors changing repeatedly
- High CPU usage
- Poor user experience

## Root Causes Found

1. **5-Second Interval**: Dashboard had `setInterval` refreshing data every 5 seconds
2. **Dynamic Timestamps**: `new Date()` was being called on every render in mock data
3. **Random Values**: Water quality metrics used `Math.random()` causing constant changes
4. **Excessive Logging**: Console logs were running on every component render

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Disabled Auto-Refresh ✅
```javascript
// BEFORE: Updated every 5 seconds
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  fetchData();
}, 5000);

// AFTER: Disabled (can be re-enabled for production with longer interval)
// const interval = setInterval(() => {
//   fetchData();
// }, 30000); // 30 seconds instead of 5
```

### 2. Static Timestamps ✅
```javascript
// BEFORE: New timestamp every render
lastUpdated: new Date()

// AFTER: Static timestamp
const STATIC_TIMESTAMP = new Date('2024-01-15T10:30:00Z');
lastUpdated: STATIC_TIMESTAMP
```

### 3. Deterministic Water Quality ✅
```javascript
// BEFORE: Random values every render
ph: acc.ph + (7.0 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2)

// AFTER: Deterministic based on pollution levels
ph: acc.ph + (7.0 + pollutionFactor * 2 - 1 + stationFactor)
```

### 4. Reduced Logging ✅
- Removed console logs that ran on every render
- Kept essential debugging logs only
- Improved performance significantly

## Result

- ✅ Map is now stable with no constant updates
- ✅ Station colors remain consistent 
- ✅ CPU usage reduced significantly
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Station status colors still work correctly (red for danger, yellow for caution)

## For Production

To re-enable real-time updates in production:
1. Uncomment the interval in Dashboard.tsx
2. Change interval to 30-60 seconds instead of 5 seconds
3. Consider using WebSocket connections for real-time data instead of polling
